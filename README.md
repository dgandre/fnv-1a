# Fowler–Noll–Vo 1a
Fowler–Noll–Vo 1a is a variant of the non-cryptographic hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll, and Kiem-Phong Vo.

# PHP Implementation
The PHP implementation of FNV 1a includes all the specified bit sizes (32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits)
The PHP implementation also include a set of test vectors

# Python 2 Implementation
Python 2 implementation of FNV 1a includes all the specified bit sizes (32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 bits)
This implementation is very straightforward as computing large numbers in python is easy
The python 2 implementation also include a set of test vectors
